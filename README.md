# Title - Titanic Visualisation

## 1. Methodology

## 2. Titatic Datset
It is added in my github repo.

This is a classic dataset used in many data mining tutorials and demos -- perfect for getting started with exploratory analysis and building binary classification models to predict survival.

Data covers passengers only, not crew

## 3. Description

I made it using dash and plotly

## 4. Screenshot


We have created a dashboard to visualise Titanic dataset via dash web app and plotly
The dataset tells the numbers of deaths and survivors on the Titanic ship and their data (like gender,age, etc) which is visualised on our dashboard. 
You are numerous graphs available in my dashboard. There is also an interactive histogram, which tells the number of survivors and dead people based on various factors, like no. of deaths in various age groups, in different passenger class, etc
